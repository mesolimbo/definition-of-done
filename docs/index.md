# Overview

This document outlines best practices and considerations for software development, deployment, and maintenance. It is intended to be a comprehensive guide covering planning and design, early development and prototyping, integration and testing, release and deployment, productionization, continuous enhancement, marketing and communication, and iterative process improvement. 

Not every step outlined is necessary for every project; there are always trade-offs between under-planning and over-engineering. Use your best judgement and omit steps when appropriate, or adopt steps incrementally as your project matures.

## Planning and Design

Your time is valuable, and so is your team's. Take some time to plan and design your software before you start writing code. This will help you avoid wasted effort and ensure that your software meets the needs of your users.

### General Planning

<details>
  <summary><strong>EPS/RFCs:</strong>
Propose and discuss technical and project scopes with your peers. This is also a good time to begin documenting your project.</summary>
    <div class="detailed">...</div>
</details><details>
  <summary><strong>Project Plan:</strong>
Identify milestones, deadlines, resource constraints, and risks. Iterate over these with stakeholders as you go.</summary>
    <div class="detailed">...</div>
</details><details>
  <summary><strong>User Stories:</strong>
Define the software's features and requirements from the user's perspective.</summary>
    <div class="detailed">...</div>
</details><details>
