# Overview

This document outlines best practices and considerations for software development, deployment, and maintenance. It is intended to be a comprehensive guide covering planning and design, early development and prototyping, integration and testing, release and deployment, productionization, continuous enhancement, marketing and communication, and iterative process improvement. 

Not every step outlined is necessary for every project; there are always trade-offs between under-planning and over-engineering. Use your best judgement and omit steps when appropriate, or adopt steps incrementally as your project matures.

## Planning and Design

Your time is valuable, and so is your team's. Take some time to plan and design your software before you start writing code. This will help you avoid wasted effort and ensure that your software meets the needs of your users.

### General Planning

<details>
  <summary><strong>EPS/RFCs:</strong>
Propose and discuss technical and project scopes with your peers. This is also a good time to begin documenting your project.</summary>
    <div class="detailed">
  EPS (Enhancement Proposal System) and RFCs (Request for Comments) are structured methods for proposing, discussing, and reaching consensus on technical changes and project scopes. They ensure everyone's input is considered and provide a record of decision-making.
</div>
</details><details>
  <summary><strong>Project Plan:</strong>
Identify milestones, deadlines, resource constraints, and risks. Iterate over these with stakeholders as you go.</summary>
    <div class="detailed">
  A project plan outlines the key milestones, deadlines, resource constraints, and potential risks of your project. It serves as a roadmap, guiding your team's efforts and helping you track progress, but still allows you to remain agile. Regularly revisiting and updating your project plan with stakeholders ensures alignment and adaptability in the face of changes and challenges.
</div>
</details><details>
  <summary><strong>User Stories:</strong>
Define the software's features and requirements from the user's perspective.</summary>
    <div class="detailed">
  User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user. They help create a simplified description of a requirement, focusing on the value or goal the user seeks. You can follow this format: "As a [Role], I want [Feature] so that [Benefit]."
</div>
</details><details>
  <summary><strong>Architecture and Design:</strong>
High-level design of the software's structure and components.</summary>
    <div class="detailed">...</div>
</details><details>
  <summary><strong>Security and Compliance Planning:</strong>
Early consideration of security and compliance requirements.</summary>
    <div class="detailed">
  Security and Compliance Planning involves identifying potential security risks and ensuring your project adheres to relevant regulations. This includes data protection, secure coding practices, and regular security audits. Compliance refers to following laws and standards relevant to your project, which can vary based on your industry and the nature of your software.

  <summary><strong>Performance & Scalability Planning:</strong>
Early consideration of performance and  scalability requirements, and potential bottlenecks.</summary>
    <div class="detailed">
  Performance & Scalability Planning involves identifying potential performance bottlenecks and planning for future growth. This includes considering how your system will handle increased load, and making design choices that allow for easy scaling. Early consideration of these factors can prevent costly rework and downtime in the future
</div>
</details><details>
  <summary><strong>Cost Estimation:</strong>
Estimation of the project's costs and resources at a high level. Remain cost conscious as the project grows.</summary>
    <div class="detailed">
  Cost Estimation involves predicting the resources and time required to complete your project. This includes considering the cost of development time, hardware, software, and any third-party services you might use. It's important to revisit and update your cost estimates regularly as your project progresses and you gain a better understanding of the work involved.
