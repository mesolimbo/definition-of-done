# Overview

This document outlines best practices and considerations for software development, deployment, and maintenance. It is intended to be a comprehensive guide covering planning and design, early development and prototyping, integration and testing, release and deployment, productionization, continuous enhancement, marketing and communication, and iterative process improvement. 

Not every step outlined is necessary for every project; there are always trade-offs between under-planning and over-engineering. Use your best judgement and omit steps when appropriate, or adopt steps incrementally as your project matures.
