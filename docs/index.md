# Overview

This document outlines the best practices and considerations for software development and deployment. It is intended to be a comprehensive guide for software development and deployment, covering planning and design, early development and prototyping, integration and testing, release and deployment, productionization, continuous enhancement, marketing and communication, and iterative process improvement. 

Not every step outlined is necessary for every project; there are always trade-offs between under-planning and over-engineering. Use your best judgement and omit steps when appropriate, or adopt steps incrementally as your project matures.

## Planning and Design

Your time is valuable, and so is your team's. Take some time to plan and design your software before you start writing code. This will help you avoid wasted effort and ensure that your software meets the needs of your users.

### General Planning
- **EPS/RFCs:** Propose and discuss technical and project scopes with your peers. This is also a good time to begin documenting your project.
- **Project Plan:** Identify milestones, deadlines, resource constraints, and risks. Iterate over these with stakeholders as you go.
- **User Stories:** Define the software's features and requirements from the user's perspective.
- **Architecture and Design:** High-level design of the software's structure and components.
- **Security and Compliance Planning:** Early consideration of security and compliance requirements.
- **Performance & Scalability Planning:** Early consideration of performance and  scalability requirements, and potential bottlenecks.
- **Cost Estimation:** Estimation of the project's costs and resources at a high level. Remain cost conscious as the project grows.

### Specialty Planning
- **Wireframes and User Experience (UX) Design:** Visual representation of the software's user interface and interactions.
- **API Design:** Define the software's API and data exchange formats early to avoid painful integration changes later.
- **Internationalization and Localization Planning:** Early consideration of internationalization and localization requirements.
- **Accessibility Planning:** Early consideration of accessibility requirements.
- **Additional Planning:** Legal, Licensing, Privacy & Regulatory, Ethical, and Sustainability Planning might all factor into your design before kick-off.

## Early Development and Prototyping
- **External Dependencies Management:** Handle third-party services and libraries systematically, preferable through package managers.
- **Testing Framework:** Tests provide early documentation and validation that software objectives align with business goals.
- **Version Control:** Use a version control system to track changes and collaborate with others.
- **Code Review:** Avoid coding alone and have peers review your code to ensure quality, maintainability, and security.
- **Working Code:** Basic functional implementation of the software with adequate testing and versioning.
- **Internal Documentation:** Code comments, READMEs, and other documentation to help others understand and contribute to the project.
- **Modularization:** Break down the software into smaller, reusable components when possible to avoid painful refactoring later.

## Integration and Testing
- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Automation of code integration from multiple contributors.
- **Security Review:** Review of the code for potential security vulnerabilities
- **Performance Review:** Review of the code for potential performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
- **QA & Security Checks:** Quality assurance and security validation processes, preferably with some level of automation.
- **Load Testing:** Testing the software's performance under heavy loads.
- **Stress Testing:** Testing the software's performance under extreme conditions.
- **Chaos Engineering:** Testing the software's resilience to failure.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Testing the software's accessibility to users with disabilities.
- **Internationalization and Localization Testing:** Testing the software's support for multiple languages and regions.
- **Compliance Testing:** Testing the software's compliance with security standards and regulations.
- **Documentation Review:** Review of the software's documentation for accuracy and completeness.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Final testing by users to ensure the software meets their needs.

## Release and Deployment`
- **Dry Run Mode:** Feature for operational validation without affecting live environments.
- **Feature Flags:** Dynamic feature toggling for testing and rollout.`
- **Release Candidate:** A version of the software that is ready for release.
- **Release Candidate Testing:** Final testing of the release candidate.
- **Release Candidate Sign Off:** Approval of the release candidate for release.
- **Rollback Plan:** Plan for reverting to a previous version in case of issues.
- **Release Plan:** Plan for deploying the software to production.
- **Deployment Plan:** Plan for deploying the software to production.
- **Training Plan:** Plan for training users and administrators on the software.
- **Support Plan:** Plan for supporting users and administrators of the software.
- **Communication Plan:** Plan for communicating with stakeholders about the release.
- **Postmortem Plan:** Plan for reviewing the release and learning from any issues.
- **Release:** Deployment of the software to production.
- **Post-Release Testing:** Testing of the software in the production environment.
- **Post-Release Sign Off:** Approval of the software in the production environment.
- **Training:** Training of users and administrators on the software.
- **Support:** Support for users and administrators of the software.
- **Staging:** Final testing in a production-mimicking environment.
- **Alpha/Beta/GA Sign Off:** Approval stages from internal, selected users, to general availability.
- **CD & Rollback (Continuous Deployment):** Automated deployment with rollback capabilities.
- **Client Impact Communication:** Stakeholder updates on releases or maintenance.
- **Release Notes:** Details on new releases' changes and improvements.

## Productionization
- **Documentation:** Creation of developer and user guides.
- **Logs:** System for error tracking and operational insight.
- **Observability:** Performance, usage, and reliability data analysis.
- **Backups & Restore:** Data protection and recovery strategies. Restore back-ups periodically to ensure they work.
- **Redundancy:** Reliability improvement through critical component duplication.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Real-time system health and issue notifications.
- **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Plan for recovering from catastrophic failures.

## Continuous Enhancement
- **Cross/Team Notifications and Walk-through/Demos/Examples:** Knowledge sharing and updates.
- **Gather Feedback:** Feedback collection for improvement.
- **Technical Debt Management:** Identifying and addressing technical debt to maintain code quality over time.
- **User Experience (UX) Design and Testing:** Focusing on the usability and user satisfaction of the software.
- **Security Compliance and Auditing:** Regular checks to ensure compliance with security standards and regulations.
- **Accessibility Compliance:** Ensuring the software is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
- **Internationalization and Localization:** Preparing the software for use in multiple languages and regions.

## Marketing and Communication
- **Sales Documentation & Training Material:** Product understanding materials for sales teams and users.
- **Announcements Email/Blog:** Public announcements on features, releases, or changes.
- **Press:** Media engagement for product coverage.
- **Events:** Product promotion and community engagement through events.
