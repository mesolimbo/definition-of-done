  content: Should the need arise to retire your product, you should have a plan in place to ensure that your users are not left in the lurch. This plan should include a strategy for protecting user data and providing a migration path to a new product or service. Even if your product reaches the end of the road, there is value in preserving documentation, old binaries and artifacts, and other historical information for future reference. Just because a product retires, doesn't mean you have to lose the support of the users and the industry. A graceful exit can open doors for future opportunities.
