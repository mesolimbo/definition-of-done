- title: Deprecation Plan
  summary: Regularly remove unused features or low-value components from the software.
  content: Just as important as adding new features and functionality is removing old ones. This is especially true for software that is used by others, as it's difficult to remove features without causing disruption after cruft accumulates. A good deprecation plan will help you remove features in a way that is as painless as possible for your users.
- title: Retirement Plan
  summary: Ensuring the protection of user data and provide a migration path when retiring your software.
  content: Should the need arise to retire your product, you should have a plan in place to ensure that you don't leave users in the lurch. This plan should include a strategy for protecting user data and providing a migration path to a new product or service. Even if your product reaches the end of the road, there is value in preserving documentation, old binaries and artifacts, and other historical information for future reference. Just because a product retires, doesn't mean you have to lose the support of the users and the industry. A graceful exit can open doors for future opportunities. Consider open sourcing your product, or donating it to a foundation or organization that can continue to maintain it.
- title: Self Improvement
  summary: Continuously improve your skills and knowledge.
  content: As a software engineer, you should always be learning and improving your skills. This is especially true in the fast-paced world of technology. You should be continuously learning new technologies, tools, and best practices, and improving your existing skills. This will help you stay relevant and competitive in the industry, and it will also help you provide more value to your team and your organization. You should also be continuously improving your soft skills, such as communication, collaboration, organization, productivity, and leadership. These skills are just as important as technical skills, and they will help you become a more effective and well-rounded engineer.
- title: Iterate Over This Definition
  summary: Continuously review and refine your development, deployment, and maintenance process, embracing improvement based on feedback, technological advancements, and evolving best practices.
  content: Like any other product or process, you should incrementally improve your development, deployment, and maintenance process, as well as your own Definition of Done. Accomplish this by reviewing and refining the process based on feedback, technological advancements, and the latest best practices. This will help you ensure your process remains efficient and effective, and that it continues to meet the needs of your users and your organization while advancing your engineering. You can call it quits when you've made the world a better place, but until then, keep iterating!
