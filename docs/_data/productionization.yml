- title: Logs and Observability
  summary: Create systems for error tracking and operational insight, and performance, usage, and reliability data analysis.
  content: Logs and observability help you understand how a system is performing and for diagnosing problems when things go wrong. Logs provide a record of what has happened in a system, and they can track down the cause of errors and performance issues. Observability refers to the ability to understand the internal state of a system based on its outputs, such as logs, metrics, and traces. Together, logs and observability can help teams understand how their systems are performing, identify problems, and make informed decisions about how to improve them.ÃŸ
- title: System Reliability
  summary: Backups & Restore, Redundancy, Monitoring & Alerting, Runbooks, and Disaster Recovery Plans to ensure system stability and recovery capabilities.
  content: System reliability ensures that a service or application is available when users need it. This includes having backups and restore capabilities in place, so that data is recoverable in the event of failure. It also includes redundancy, so that if one part of the system fails, there are other parts that can take over. Monitoring and alerting are important for detecting problems and notifying the people who can address the issue. Runbooks provide a set of procedures for responding to common problems, and disaster recovery plans provide a roadmap for recovering from major outages or disasters. Together, these elements help ensure that a system is reliable and can recover from failures.
- title: Performance and Security Management
  summary: Establish a Scaling Plan, optimize performance, patch regularly, and carry out Compliance Auditing to maintain optimal operation and healthy security posture.
  content: A scaling plan ensures that the system can handle increased load as it grows. Performance optimization involves identifying and addressing bottlenecks and other issues that can slow down the system. Security hardening and patching ensure that the system is safe against known vulnerabilities, and compliance auditing ensures that the system meets relevant security standards and regulations. Together, these elements help ensure that a system is performant and secure.
- title: Operational Tools and Processes
  summary: Build diagnostic tools, establish change management processes, and establish configuration management processes for efficient operation and management of software changes.
  content: Diagnostic tools help teams understand how a system is performing and diagnose problems when things go wrong. Change management ensures that changes to the system happen in a controlled and predictable manner, and configuration management ensures that the system configuration is consistently correct. Together, these elements help ensure that a system is healthy, efficient, and manageable.
- title: Robust Documentation
  summary: The documentation of a fully productionized service or application should answer most of a user's questions, from getting started to advanced troubleshooting.
  content: Documentation should be comprehensive, easy to understand, and up-to-date. It should cover all aspects of the software, from installation and configuration to troubleshooting and advanced usage. Docs should also include examples, tutorials, and best practices to help users get the most out of the software. Good documentation can save users time and frustration, and it can also reduce the burden on support teams. Great documentation also helps attract new users and contributors, by demonstrating that the project is well-maintained and user-friendly.
- title: User Engagement and Management
  summary: Deploy systems and processes for User Feedback Collection, User Support, User Training, User Management, User Account and Data Recovery, User Data Handling, and User Data Security, ensuring comprehensive support and data protection.
  content: You want to make sure your users have a positive experience with a service or application. This includes collecting and acting on user feedback, providing support and training, managing user accounts and data, and ensuring the secure handling of user data with an appropriate level of respect. Together, these elements help ensure that users have a positive experience and that their data is safe.
