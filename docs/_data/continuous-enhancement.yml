- title: Cross-team Notifications, Walk-through, and Demos
  summary: Actively share knowledge and updates.
  content: Your software might be ready for prime time, but the work doesn't stop there. Make sure that you reach out to everyone who needs to know about your software and expose your work to them. This includes other teams within your organization, as well as external stakeholders. You need to provide clear documentation and examples so that they fully understand how your software can help them. Good software is a force multiplier, but only if it is within reach of those who need it.
- title: Gather Feedback
  summary: Collect feedback for improvement.
  content: Adopt a growth mindset and proactively seek feedback from internal and external users, stakeholders, and team members. This feedback will help you understand how your software is being used, and where you can improve it. This feedback can come from a variety of sources, including user surveys, support tickets, and direct conversations with users. The more feedback you can gather, the better you'll be able to deliver a world-class software experience.
- title: Technical Debt Management
  summary: Identify and address technical debt to maintain code quality.
  content: Great should not be the enemy of good, and done is better than perfect, so it's ok to make compromises to deliver value sooner. That said, track and manage technical debt to ensure that it doesn't get out of hand. Technical debt results from making compromises in the short term that will require additional work in the future. This can include things like skipping tests, taking shortcuts, or using outdated technology. If you're not careful, technical debt can accumulate and make it difficult to maintain and improve your software. You need to be aware of the technical debt in your software and have a plan for addressing it regularly.
- title: User Experience (UX) Design and Testing
  summary: Focus on the usability and user satisfaction of your software.
  content: No amount of expertise can replace the value of user feedback from the field. You need to make sure that your software is easy to use, and that it meets the needs of your users. This requires a comprehensive UX design and testing strategy that includes everything from user interviews to usability testing. The more you can understand about how your users interact with your software, the better you'll be able to make it meet their needs. Great software continues to empower future users beyond its original design with less effort. Learn to run experiments safely, such as A/B testing, to validate your assumptions and make data-driven decisions.
- title: Security Compliance and Auditing
  summary: Check regularly to ensure compliance with security standards and regulations.
  content: Even as your software becomes stable, you must continue to invest effort regularly to ensure that it remains secure. This includes regular security audits, as well as compliance with security standards and regulations. The more you can do to ensure the security of your software, the better you'll be able to protect your users and your organization. Security is a process, not a product, and you need to make sure that your software is secure at every stage of its lifecycle.
- title: Accessibility Compliance
  summary: Ensure your software remains accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, and compliant with other relevant standards and regulations.
  content: Like security, the accessibility requirements your software must meet might change even if the software itself doesn't. You need to make sure that your software is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, and that it meets other relevant standards and regulations such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The more you can do to ensure that your software is accessible and compliant, the better you'll be able to serve all of your users.
- title: Regulatory Compliance
  summary: Ensuring the software meets all relevant standards and regulations.
  content: It is in your best interest to keep abreast of legislation that affects your industry, so that you don't find yourself in a panic when new laws pass. You need to make sure that your software meets all relevant standards and regulations, and that it complies with all relevant laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Digital Services Act (DSA). The more you can do to ensure that your software is compliant, the better you'll be able to protect your users and maintain trust in your organization.
- title: Keeping Up with Technology
