- title: EPS/RFCs
  summary: Propose and discuss technical and project scopes with your peers. This is also a good time to begin documenting your project.
  content: EPS (Enhancement Proposal System) and RFCs (Request for Comments) are structured methods for proposing, discussing, and reaching consensus on technical changes and project scopes. They ensure everyone's input is considered and provide a record of decision-making.
- title: Project Plan
  summary: Identify milestones, deadlines, resource constraints, and risks. Iterate over these with stakeholders as you go.
  content: A project plan outlines the key milestones, deadlines, resource constraints, and potential risks of your project. It serves as a roadmap, guiding your team's efforts and helping you track progress, but still allows you to remain agile. Regularly revisiting and updating your project plan with stakeholders ensures alignment and adaptability in the face of changes and challenges.
- title: User Stories
  summary: Define the software's features and requirements from the user's perspective.
  content: >
    <p>User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user. They help create a simplified description of a requirement, focusing on the value or goal the user seeks. You can follow this format:</p>
    <p>"As a [Role], I want [Feature] so that [Benefit]."</p>
- title: Architecture and Design
  summary: High-level design of the software's structure and components.
  content: The architecture and design phase involves creating a high-level structure of the software, which includes defining the software components, their external properties, and their relationships with other software. This phase also involves making strategic decisions related to the way the software will be built and deployed, such as choosing the appropriate design patterns, frameworks, and technologies. It's important to consider factors like scalability, maintainability, and security during this phase.
- title: Security and Compliance Planning
  summary: Early consideration of security and compliance requirements.
  content: Security and Compliance Planning involves identifying potential security risks and ensuring your project adheres to relevant regulations. This includes data protection, secure coding practices, and regular security audits. Compliance refers to following laws and standards relevant to your project, which can vary based on your industry and the nature of your software.
- title: Performance & Scalability Planning
  summary: Early consideration of performance and  scalability requirements, and potential bottlenecks.
  content: Performance & Scalability Planning involves identifying potential performance bottlenecks and planning for future growth. This includes considering how your system will handle increased load, and making design choices that allow for easy scaling. Early consideration of these factors can prevent costly rework and downtime in the future
- title: Cost Estimation
  summary: Estimation of the project's costs and resources at a high level. Remain cost conscious as the project grows.
  content: Cost Estimation involves predicting the resources and time required to complete your project. This includes considering the cost of development time, hardware, software, and any third-party services you might use. It's important to revisit and update your cost estimates regularly as your project progresses and you gain a better understanding of the work involved.
- title: Wireframes and User Experience (UX) Design
  summary: Visual representation of the software's user interface and interactions.
  content: Wireframes and UX Design involve creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of your software. This process helps to arrange elements to best accomplish a particular purpose. For example, you might outline where buttons, images, and text will be placed within the interface. UX Design, on the other hand, is about enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability and accessibility of your software. This could involve designing smooth navigation, intuitive layouts, and interactive elements that provide a seamless experience for the user.
- title: API Design
  summary: Define the software's API and data exchange formats early to avoid painful integration changes later.
  content: API Design involves defining the interfaces through which interactions happen between an application and other software. This includes deciding on the structure of the API endpoints, the request/response formats, and the conventions to be followed. For example, in a RESTful API, you might have endpoints like `GET /users` for retrieving a list of users and `POST /users` for creating a new user. The design should also consider aspects like error handling, security, and versioning to ensure the API is robust, secure, and can evolve over time.
- title: Internationalization and Localization Planning
  summary: Early consideration of internationalization and localization requirements.
  content: Internationalization and Localization Planning involves preparing your software for use in different regions and languages. This includes designing and implementing features that support multiple languages, date and time formats, number formats, and cultural norms. For example, you might use libraries or frameworks that support internationalization, or design your UI to be flexible for different text directions and lengths. It's also important to consider localization, which involves adapting your software to meet the language, cultural, and other requirements of a specific region.
- title: Accessibility Planning
  summary: Early consideration of accessibility requirements.
  content: Accessibility Planning involves designing your software to be usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. This could involve ensuring your software is compatible with assistive technologies, providing alternative text for images, and designing for various input methods. It's also important to consider color contrast, font size, and layout for those with visual impairments.
- title: Additional Planning
  summary: Legal, Licensing, Privacy & Regulatory, Ethical, and Sustainability Planning might all factor into your design before kick-off.
  content: Additional Planning may include Legal, Licensing, Privacy & Regulatory, Ethical, and Sustainability considerations. This involves understanding and complying with relevant laws and regulations, choosing appropriate licenses for your software, planning for privacy and data protection, considering the ethical implications of your software, and making decisions that promote sustainability. For example, you might need to comply with data protection laws, choose an open-source license, develop a privacy policy, consider the impact of your software on society, and aim to minimize the environmental impact of your software's development and operation.
