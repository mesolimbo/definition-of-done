- title: External Dependencies Management
  summary: Handle third-party services and libraries systematically, preferable through package managers.
  content: External Dependencies Management involves handling third-party services and libraries systematically, preferably through package managers. This includes identifying the dependencies your software needs, choosing reliable libraries and services, and using a package manager to manage them. For example, in a Ruby project, you might use Bundler to manage your gems. It's also important to keep your dependencies up to date and to monitor them for security vulnerabilities. Regularly updating your dependencies can help you take advantage of bug fixes and new features, and can also help keep your software secure.
- title: Testing Framework
  summary: Tests provide early documentation and validation that software objectives align with business goals.
  content: Testing Framework involves setting up a systematic approach to test your software for its functionality and performance. This includes leveraging Test Driven Development (TDD) which involves writing tests before the actual code. Automated unit and integration tests are a key part of this process, ensuring each part of the software works individually and collectively. Linting is also important, helping to maintain code quality and prevent potential errors. In a Ruby project, you might use RSpec or MiniTest for testing and RuboCop for linting. Regularly running these tests and linters can help catch issues early, improve code quality, and reduce debugging time.
- title: Version Control
  summary: Use a version control system to track changes and collaborate with others.
  content: Version Control, typically using Git, allows tracking and managing code changes. It enables collaboration and provides a history of changes, as well as a form of remote back-ups. Branching strategies like GitFlow can help keep async collaboration smooth. Regularly pull from the remote repository to keep your local repository updated, and push your changes to share them with others.
- title: Code Review
  summary: Avoid coding alone and have peers review your code to ensure quality, maintainability, and security.
  content: Code Review is a systematic examination of software source code, done to find and fix mistakes overlooked during the initial development phase. This improves the overall quality of software. Reviews are done in various forms such as pair programming, informal walkthroughs, and formal inspections. In a Ruby project, you might use tools like RuboCop for static code analysis. Code reviews are also a learning opportunity, allowing developers to understand new techniques and design patterns.
- title: Working Code
  summary: Basic functional implementation of the software with adequate testing and versioning.
  content: Working Code refers to the functional implementation of the software. It's the core of any software project and often the primary focus of developers. This involves writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code that implements the desired features and meets the defined requirements. It's important to follow good coding practices, such as adhering to a style guide, using meaningful names for variables and functions, and organizing code into logical modules or classes. In a Ruby project, you might use tools like RuboCop to enforce a consistent style. Remember, the goal is not just to write code that works, but code that is easy to understand, modify, and debug.
- title: Internal Documentation
  summary: Code comments, READMEs, and other documentation to help others understand and contribute to the project.
  content: Internal Documentation is crucial for maintaining code readability and facilitating collaboration. This includes code comments, README files, and technical specifications. Code comments should be concise and meaningful, explaining the purpose and functionality of code blocks. In Python, you might use docstrings for function and class documentation. README files provide an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage examples. Technical specifications detail the software's architecture, data models, and algorithms. In a Go project, you might use godoc for generating API documentation. In Java, Javadoc serves a similar purpose. Remember, good documentation reduces the learning curve for new team members and promotes maintainability.
- title: Modularization
  summary: Break down the software into smaller, reusable components when possible to avoid painful refactoring later.
  content: Modularization is about breaking software into smaller, reusable components, improving manageability and reducing complexity. Principles like SOLID and GRASP guide this process. SOLID stands for five principles for maintainable and scalable systems, while GRASP provides guidelines for object-oriented design. Following these principles, along with others like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), promotes clean and maintainable code. In Java, packages organize related classes, while in Python, modules serve a similar purpose.
