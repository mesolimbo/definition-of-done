## Integration and Testing

<details>
    <summary><strong>CI (Continuous Integration):</strong>
        Automation of code integration from multiple contributors.</summary>
    <div class="detailed">
    Continuous Integration (CI) is a vital practice in modern software development that encourages developers to frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository. This is followed by automated builds and tests, providing immediate feedback on the integrations. CI brings numerous benefits such as rapid feedback, reduced risk, increased confidence, faster release rate, improved developer productivity, better quality software, and cost savings. It helps in delivering high-quality software more rapidly and with fewer bugs, making it a critical component of agile software development practices.
